# Proxyshop Plugins by FelixVita

## The Ancient Template

This is what you're probably here for.

_Ancient_ is a custom plugin for [Proxyshop](https://github.com/MrTeferi/MTG-Proxyshop.git) which lets you create cards with the [old-school/classic frame](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%28frame%3A1993+or+frame%3A1997%29).

This template / plugin is my main project, and is by far the largest plugin in terms of complexity and number of lines of code.

## Other plugins: Modern & Normal Plus

Although developing _Ancient_ has been my primary focus, I have additionally made a few spin-offs of the default "Normal" template

### Modern

The _Modern_ template / plugin lets you create cards with the [modern frame](https://scryfall.com/search?q=frame%3Amodern+-is%3Adigital).
It is basically the same as `normal.psd` except for the following modifications:

- Bottom part of the card frame is added back in
- Square frame instead of rounded corners
- Added Artist & Collector Info in the modern frame style (paintbrush icon, mock copyright, etc.)
- Added masks to the nyxtouched cards to make the starry frame effect only go about halfway down the card
- Added [miracles](https://scryfall.com/search?q=frame%3Amiracle) frame effect
- Adds functionality to use SVGs (e.g. from CCGHQ) in place of the set symbols normally generated by Proxyshop.

### Normal Plus

The _Normal Plus_ plugin just adds some extra features to the default "Normal" template to bring its appearance even closer how the [M15 frame](https://scryfall.com/search?q=frame%3Am15+-is%3Adigital) really looks, by adding the following features:

- Adds an optional "BS & Copyleft" copyright line to the bottom right of the card, for a slightly more authentic look at a glance.
- Fixes the collector's info for cards like [[Mind Stone (AFC)]] by hiding card count whenever collector number is greater than card count.)
- Adds functionality to use SVGs (e.g. from CCGHQ) in place of the set symbols normally generated by Proxyshop.

Note that the _Normal Plus_ plugin has no accompanying custom photoshop template. It simply uses your existing `normal.psd` file. That said, if you wish to use the feature `enable_text_copyleft_proxy_not_for_sale` to place a "mock copyright" in the bottom right corner, then make sure you remember to download `bscopyleft.psb` (as explained in the instructions below).

#### Normal Plus Class: Miracle

The _Miracle Plus_ plugin does the exact same thing for the existing _Miracle_ template as _Normal Plus_ does for the _Normal_ template.

#### Normal Plus Class: Invention

The _Invention Bronze Plus_ plugin does the exact same thing for the existing _Invention Bronze_ template as _Normal Plus_ does for the _Normal_ template.
Additionally, it adds the orange gradient in the rules text box — a visual element which (as of 2022-Oct-14) is still missing from the current masterpiece.psd template.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you are using the right version of Proxyshop. The FelixVita-Proxyshop-Plugins are compatible with [Proxyshop v1.1.8](https://github.com/MrTeferi/MTG-Proxyshop/releases/tag/v1.1.8)

### Installing the FelixVita plugin package

1. Go to the latest release of the plugin [here](https://github.com/HelixVita/FelixVita-Proxyshop-Plugins/releases/latest) and download it by clicking `Source code (zip)` (under "Assets").

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102387379/191358011-81f4138c-8ed8-45ae-a532-17d5931a6524.png)

1. Unzip the folder and place it into your Proxyshop `plugins` folder, so that it looks something like this:

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102387379/191348877-72feeadd-28c0-4002-b48d-1a83ddcab31e.png)

1. Rename it to get rid of the version number at the end, like so:

1. Create a new folder named `FelixVita` inside the Proxyshop `templates` folder, then download [these](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EqmL85czp44qWXaSpmN-DSJk430ocMkN?usp=sharing) files and place them there, like so:

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102387379/193914068-3e5020e9-c823-4f09-868d-c7a2c5a06c73.png)

1. Optional (for better-looking set symbols): Create another new folder in `templates` named `CCGHQ`, then download the CCGHQ Set Symbol SVG files from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e84z5l5za99uwah/AAAKbGdgCW1uM1wZ3T128OYya?dl=0) and place them inside, so that the path looks like this:

1. Run Proxyshop. You should now see "Ancient", "Modern", and "Normal Plus" (and its class variants) in the list of available templates. Enjoy!

## A Note Regarding the CCGHQ Set Symbol SVGs

Downloading these is completely optional. All the plugins will run completely fine without it. They just make the set symbols look a bit better (imho).

When enabled, Proxyshop will attempt to use CCGHQ set symbol SVGs instead of generating set symbols using the info from `symbols.json`, except when:

- I've deemed that the Proxyshop one looks more authentic; or
- An error was encountered when attempting to load the CCGHQ SVG

Please also note that I have not yet checked every set symbol to ensure that it looks authentic. (I have thus far only done that for the sets from Alpha to Scourge, i.e. the old-school/classic frame cards relevant to the _Ancient_ template).

## Optional user configuration

You have the option to toggle certain behaviors on and off by modifying the `config.json` file, located here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102387379/195993272-00d341c7-61c4-4a1e-a59a-a43be9f66905.png)

Simply open the file in Notepad and change the value of the config option you wish to modify. It'll look something like this:

### Explanation of what each configuration option means

### What does true/false mean?

Each config option has exactly three possible values: `true`, `false`, or `"authentic"`

You must always pick one of these values. If you write something else or misspell them (for example 'True' instead of 'true'), then Proxyshop will fail.

However there are four exceptions to this rule.

### Exception 1: Art Position Memory

The config options with names starting in `art_position` do not have the `authentic` option, because they are not related to the card's authenticity.

Instead they have the `"auto"` option.

### Exception 2: The "remaster" value

An additional possible config value `"remaster"` exists for the following config options:

- use_tombstone_icon
- use_legendary_crown

The idea behind this `"remaster"` option is essentially:
> "If wotc had printed the card today, it'd be printed this way"

This differs from the `"authentic"` option, whose philosophy could be stated as:
> "I don't care about what the card would've looked like if reprinted by wotc; I want the card to look as close as possible to the original printing."

### Exception 3: The `custom_collector_string` option

The `custom_collector_string` option applies collector's info to the set layer, in a user-defined format, using a mix of variables and free text. The variables are

```text
<PrintYear>
<Set>
<CollectorNumber>
<CardCount>
<Rarity>
```

For example, if you're rendering `Skullclamp [DST]` and you've modified `custom_collector_string` to say

```text
<PrintYear> Joe Proxy * Not for Sanctioned Play * <Set> <CollectorNumber>/<CardCount> <Rarity>
```

Then this will produce something like:

> 2004 Joe Proxy • Not for Sanctioned Play • DST 140/165 U

and if any collector info is missing, it will simply be omitted.

### Exception 4: The `frame_style` option

This option is specific to the _Ancient_ template, and has the following possible values:

- "real-93" - will render cards in the 1993 frame style (used in the sets Alpha to Alliances) by using frame assets sourced from real scans of Arabian Nights cards
- "mock-93" - will render cards using using the colors and textures of the 1993 frame, but also using the wider rules text box and higher resolution of the 1997 frame
- "1997" — will render cards in the 1997 frame style (used in the sets Mirage to Scourge) by using frame assets sourced from CardConjurer (heavily modified to look more authentic)
- "authentic" - will automatically choose the frame style based on the card's set, and will use the "real-93" style for sets Alpha to Alliances, and the "1997" style for sets Mirage to Scourge
- "remaster" - same as "1997"
